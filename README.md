PyVulnCrawler is a program I created desinged to help penetration testers or companies discover any vulnerabilities in their website.

This is meant to be used for educational purposes only, whatever you decide to do with this software is not on me, if you get in trouble that is on YOU

I created this program because I personally hate looking for vulnerabilities on websites including my own sites, so this is meant to make it a handful easier :) 

To use this software it is pretty straight forward, changed it to be simple for people that are still learning. 

Either `git clone ` the folder to your terminal or donwload it 

Open your terminal if it is not already open :)

Do the following commands: 

`cd PyVulnCrawler` 

`python3 PTV2.py` 

You will be prompted with: `Enter the URL of the website to scan:` enter the url of the website you want to scan

Example: `Enter the URL of the website to scan: https://www.example.com` 

Make sure you include `https://` or `http://` before the url, otherwise it will fail and not work. 

Press `Enter` 

You will have to wait some time depending on how big the website is, as it as to go through all the pages on the website of your choice, and check them. 

This process could take anywhere from 1-10 minutes for smaller websites to 10min-1hour for larger wesbites

So be patient :) 

DO NOT USE ON .gov websites, that is on YOU if you choose to, other words don't be a idiot (talking to any skids viewing this)
